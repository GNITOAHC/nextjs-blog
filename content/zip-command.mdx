## Examples

1. Zipping simple files

   ```shell
   zip zip.zip hello.c world.c
   ```

2. Zipping a directory

   ```shell
   zip -r zip.zip .
   ```

   This command will zip the entire directory into the zip file.

3. Zipping a directory while excluding some subdirectories

   ```shell
   zip -r zip.zip . -x "node_modules/*"
   ```

   This command will exclude the subdirectory `node_modules`.

   ```shell
   zip -r zip.zip . -x \*.o
   ```

4. Zipping files and moving them into the archive

   ```shell
   zip -m documents.zip *.txt
   ```

   This command will zip all `.txt` files into `documents.zip` and then delete the original `.txt` files from the folder.

## Browsing the zip file information

To browse the contents of a zip file using Vim or Neovim, you can simply open the zip file with either editor.  
These editors have built-in support for browsing zip archives.

```shell
vim filename.zip
# or
nvim filename.zip
```

Upon opening the zip file in Vim or Neovim, you'll see a list of files contained in the archive.  
You can navigate through this list to view the contents of individual files.  
Remember that you're viewing the contents in a read-only mode â€“ changes made here won't affect the actual files inside the zip archive.
