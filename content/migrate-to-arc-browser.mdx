title: Migrating from Safari & Chrome to Arc on MacOS
date: 2023-11-09
summary: A new experience of web browsing on Mac
---

Recently, I'm finding a new experience of web browsing on Mac because of the inconsistent of Chrome on Mac and the inconvenience of Safari.

# Safari on Mac

First of all, Safari being a default browser of Mac isn't Chromium. This makes some websites not working on it. For instance, KKBOX, my favorite streaming service, only works on Chromium.
The website [play.kkbox.com](https://play.kkbox.com) will tell you to switch to Google Chrome if you visit it with Safari.
Moreover, I'm not really used to the web dev tools built-in with Safari even though I tried to, most of the time I just switch back to Chrome.
While, I think it's just a personal preference. BTW, Responsive Web Design tools in Chrome is mush better in my opinion. (Safari needs to manually add simulator while Chrome have embedded support for lots of different devices.)

To conclude, the main reason that I don't like Safari is as follows:

1. Not Chromium
2. Dev-tools
3. Multi-profile system (This will be covered in the next section.)

# Chrome on Mac

When it comes to Chrome on Mac, it's blazing fast, especially the multi-profile system, it's much more intuitive compare to Safari's on version 17.
While the main drawbacks is that according to `top -o cpu`, Chrome and Chrome helper always have a high CPU usage, not to mention hot-reload when developing.
Besides, Stage Manager and Chrome seems to be enemy. Frequently changing the focus window will cause Chrome act weirdly. (e.g. Showing icon in stage manager but have zero window)

As above, the main reason to migrate is as follows:

1. High CPU usage
2. Not compatible with Stage Manager

# Migrating to Arc Browser

Apart from the above five reasons, there is one more point for me to migrate and that is switching from one to another browser on same machine is not convienient.
Most of the time I use Safari cause I store my passwords in iCloud, but when I need to develop or use G-suite (e.g. Google docs/slides, Gmail), Google Chrome has a better experience.
Before migrating to new browser, I use iCloud for windows to sync my bookmarks and by the way, [this requires a Microsoft Windows to be your sync server](https://www.reddit.com/r/browsers/comments/jjrtp6/sync_chrome_and_safari_bookmarks/?rdt=57209), which is very inconvenient.

## Raindrop for Bookmarks

To overcome these obstacles, I find a new bookmark manager to store my bookmarks, called [Raindrop](https://raindrop.io).
After using third party bookmark manager, my bookmarks became portable and do not rely on Apple or Google. Though it indeed requires a plugin on the target browser.

## Dropbox Passwords

Before migrating, my passwords is default storing on iCloud, while some of the passwords are store in Chrome.
Overall, my passwords storage is a huge desaster. Some on iCloud, some on Chrome and some duplicated.
Although there is a plugin to use iCloud passwords inside Chrome but the process is complicated, not to mention using it on Windows.

After searching for password managers, I decided to use [Dropbox Passwords](https://www.dropbox.com/zh_TW/features/security/passwords) because I personally have a Dropbox Plus, but Dropbox Passwords is available for all plans including Dropbox Basic (free version).
Dropbox Passwords is available for all devices though it requires a plugin on computer like Raindrop did and requires an app on iOS and Android.
But for me, using one password manager with Apps or extensions instead of manually update password on both iCloud and Google is much more easier.

## Portable configurations

After using Raindrop and Dropbox Passwords, I have fully make my personal prefrerences portable to any browser. So now it's time to migrate.
By the way, following are some more options for third party bookmarks manager and password manager:

- Bookmark Manager
  1. [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/)
  2. [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/)
  3. [Diigo](https://www.diigo.com/)
- Password Manager
  1. [NordPass](https://nordpass.com/)
  2. [1Password](https://1password.com/)

Back to migration, after `brew install arc`, I set it as my default browser. Now that next time I open links inside Apple notes, it'll default open it inside Arc.
In addition, I remove Safari and Chrome from Dock and replace it with single app - Arc.

## Setting up Arc browser

First, add extensions from `Extensions > Add Extension ...`. Because Arc is chromium, all Chrome extensions work on Arc.
In addition, Arc provides [Boost](https://arc.net/boosts) for costumizing certain website.
After installing my password and bookmark manager, I additionally pinned Raindrop to make it more accessible.

Secondly, adding profiles for different workspace is essential to me as well.

Last but not least, explore some cool features of this browser is really exciting!! Maybe after more exploring, I'll write a new blog about this Arc browser.
Hope this one is more compatible with the Stage Manager.

Actually, after setting up a third-party password & bookmark manager, exploring on different broswer seems to be very convenient, because Dropbox and Raindrop do a very great job intergrating their project into different environment.
Arc does not support Windows and I still use Chrome as my default browser on my Asus. Thanks to them, I can work very fluently without any barrier on different platforms.
